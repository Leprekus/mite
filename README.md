# Mite! 「見て!」- Algorithm Visualizer

## About 

Step-through visualizations of classic graph algorithms. Add nodes/edges on a canvas, pick an algorithm, then play, pause, or step through each operation.
(Live Demo)[]

## Features

* Interactive canvas (click to add nodes; create/delete edges).
* Stepper controls: play, pause, step forward/back, reset, clear.
* Algorithms (initial set): Kruskal, Prim, Dijkstra, Bellman–Ford.

## Controls

* Buttons: Step Back ◀︎ | Play/Pause ▶︎/⏸ | Step Forward ▶︎▶︎ | Reset ↺ | Clear 🗑
* Dropdown: Choose algorithm (Kruskal / Prim / Dijkstra / Bellman–Ford)
* Canvas: Click to add a node at cursor
* Keyboard:
    * c → toggle edge creation mode
    * x → delete selected node

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
